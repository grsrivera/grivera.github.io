  <!-- Had to set picture box height to auto for all. May be a setting I had camera set to in Bolivia, but the sizes are off.
   Height: auto removes excessive white-space in top border of picture-box -->

          Locals recommended drinking coca tea to help adjust to the altitude—La Paz sits at 11,900 ft and is the highest administrative capital in the world. The leaves can also be chewed which will numb your mouth like novocaine. You'll see locals chewing the leaves throughout the day for an energy boost.

There's a trail you can hike on the island that takes you to all of the ruins and is only 4 mi, but I thought my heart was going to explode the whole time because of the altitude.

          Roadblocks are common in Bolivia. This was one outside of the city of Uyuni in protest of the new bus terminal. I was told vendors will lose customers because of the new location. The other riders and I took the overnight bus 10 hrs from La Paz and got dropped off 5 mi from the city. Luckily, we found taxis after a mile or so of walking.

          The train graveyard outside of Uyuni. Bolivia has the largest lithium reserve in the world. Most of the lithium the country currently produces passes through the active set of tracks here. Surprisingly, Bolivia is also South America's poorest country. Their government is still developing the process to efficiently mine the metal, which is harder to do at high altitudes.

          The city of Potosí, Bolivia, with the peak of Cerro Rico in the background. Historians estimate that eight million native Quechua slaves died extracting silver from the mountain for the Spanish crown between the 16th and 18th centuries. The mountain has been excavated to the point that it may collapse. The mines are still active today, but the locals now mine lesser metals like tin.

          The ruins of El Fuerte outside of Samaipata, Bolivia. The Inca and native Chané lived together here starting as early as the 15th century. Archaeologists believe chicha (corn beer) was ceremoniously poured down the two channels in the distance. The wall in the middle was possibly used to identify the solstices and determine which crops should be planted. The eroded circular carving closer in the shot is of a jaguar.

I crossed back into Brazil and stayed at a lodge outside of the city of Corumbá for three days.
